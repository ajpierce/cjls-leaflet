# cljs-leaflet

A playground/laboratory for using clojurescript to manipulate leaflet maps

## Overview

The goal of this project is to learn how to use immutable data structures to
manage the data present on a map, and to do so without "jank" (flickering or
stuttering of all data on the map)

## Setup
On OSX, install readline wrapper for an improved REPL experience:

    brew install rlwrap

To get an interactive development environment run:

    rlwrap lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

### Add Secrets File
Add the following code to `src/cljs_leaflet/secrets.cljs`, replacing `your_api_key` with a valid Mapbox API key:

```clojure
(ns cljs-leaflet.secrets)
(defonce mapbox-api-key "your_api_key")
```
